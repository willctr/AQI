# AQI Data Science Project
A machine learning program about AQI.

## Description
This project is an implementation of a machine learning model to predict AQI. This project involves the analysis of air quality data collected from various sources. The data includes measurements for different pollutants such as Ozone (O₃), Particulate Matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀), Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), and Carbon Monoxide (CO), along with Air Quality Index (AQI) data. The goal of the project is to clean, store, and analyze this data to gain insights into air quality trends over the years.

## Data Source
Dataset: Daily AQI from EPA
