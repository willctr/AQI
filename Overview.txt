Predicting Air Quality Index (AQI)

Develop and train a MLM to predict AQI based on environmental factors such as 
temp, humidity, wind speed, pollutant levels PM2.5, CO2, O3, etc

Steps Overview:
1. Data collection: source AQI data from EPA, NOAA, Kaggle
    Ensure dta covers multiple locations and time periods. 
    Define the scope.

2. Data processessing: clean the data

3. Use visualizations to explore relationships between AQI and different
    environmental factors with Matplotlib or Seaborn.
    Identify trends, seasonlity, outliers.

4. Feature engineering: create new features that improve model performance.
    Lag features, interaction terms.
    Select important features using techniques like correlation analysis and 
    feature importance from preliminary models.

5. Model building: split the data into training and testing sets.
    Train multiple regression models: linear regression, Decision trees, 
    random forest, gradient boosting.
    Eval models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error,
    and R-squared.

6. Model eval and hyperparameter tuning: use cross-validation to asses model 
    stability. 
    tune hyperparameters using grid search or random search to optimize model
    performance.

7. Model deployment: create a jupyter notebook or a streamlit dashboard to
    showcase model's predictions.
    Include visualizations of actual vs. predicted AQI values and model
    performance metrics.
